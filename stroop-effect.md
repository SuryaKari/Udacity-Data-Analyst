## Q & A

### What is our independent variable? What is our dependent variable?

Our Independent variable is the color of the printed word on the screen. 
The Dependent variable is the time it takes to read the color of the printed word on the screen. 

### What is an appropriate set of hypotheses for this task? What kind of statistical test do you expect to perform? Justify your choices.

* **Null Hypothesis** : The null hypothesis will state that the times taken for a reader to read congruent letters vs the incongruent letters is the same and has no effect on the reading times

* **Alternate Hypothesis** : This hypothesis states that the times taken for a reader to read congruent letters is **DIFFERENT** from the incongruent letters. Technically, we know that it will take longer to read letters that say a color but are in different color and this would warrant an one tailed T-test in the positive direction.But in the real world, experiments rarely know which direction the test will need to be tested, so we will perform a two tailed Paired T-test here
